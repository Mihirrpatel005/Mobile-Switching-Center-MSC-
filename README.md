# Mobile-Switching-Center-MSC-

Model the behavior of a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) as it allocates and deallocates channels to

connections using a fixed allocation scheme.


This is a simulation. As a result, you need only write a single program which will run on a single

machine. You will decide what algorithm the MSC uses to allocate channels.

You should assume 3 cell reuse (cluster size N = 3) and a coverage area of 9 hexagonal cells (3 clusters)

which are adjacent. The cells in cluster A are numbered 1,2,3, cluster B are 4,5,6, and cluster C are

7,8,9. See figure below.
